# Real-Time Quiz Game Backend
This project is a backend implementation for a real-time quiz game where two players compete against each other by answering the same set of questions. The game uses NestJS, MongoDB, and WebSockets to handle real-time communication, user authentication, game session management, and more.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login using JWT.
- **Game Session Setup**: Create and manage game sessions, and notify players when the game starts.
- **Question Management**: Pre-store questions in MongoDB, each with multiple choices and a correct answer.
- **Real-Time Question Delivery**: Send questions to players one by one in real-time.
- **Answer Submission and Scoring**: Handle player answers, validate them, and calculate scores.
- **Result Calculation**: Determine the winner after all questions are answered and store the game results.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: NestJS
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets (using Socket.IO)
- **Authentication**: JWT for user authentication
